# Jeopardy

## Motivation

I was inspired by Tom Scott's YouTube game show [Lateral](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGLZj-FTNfZYmo3uv6-MJ0D-) to create a trivia series for [Silicon Valley Offbeat Fun](https://www.meetup.com/Offbeat-Fun/).

If I wanted to play my own game, I needed to find pre-made questions so I would not know the answers. The quality of online trivia databases is usually low&mdash;see [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/browse.php).

Questions from Jeopardy are known to be high quality. Thanks to a dedicated fanbase, more than 300,000 questions from over 30 years on air are archived online.

## Operation

Questions are pulled from the [J! Archive](http://j-archive.com/) using [jService](http://jservice.io/), then are displayed to look like the real Jeopardy television show.

One person operates the game. The program is designed to run on a laptop connected to a TV. The laptop's display is only visible to the operator, and the TV is visible to all the contestants. The operator reads questions out loud and judges whether a response is close enough to the correct answer.

## Buzzers

Commercial buzzers for trivia exist but are very expensive.

My DIY solution uses Linemaster Treadlite foot switches and parts from an HP 697737 USB Keyboard. It is similar to [this](https://www.gameshowpresenter.com/buzzers/EasyButton.html) project which uses [Staples Easy Buttons](https://www.staples.com/Staples-Easy-Button/product_606396).
