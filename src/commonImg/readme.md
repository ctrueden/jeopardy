The crossed-out eye icon is "hide" by Stephen Hutchings from the Microns collection. I changed the fill color from black to white. I originally found it on [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/367827/hide) which says it is under the PD License (public domain) but I think that is wrong. The original source is [Github](https://github.com/stephenhutchings/microns) which says the license is CC BY-SA 3.0.

The checkmark icon was made by Peter Froud in Inkscape.
